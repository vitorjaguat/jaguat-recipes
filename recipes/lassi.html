    <h1>Salted Lassi</h1>

    <p>I don't know why we're ingrained from childhood to equate thirst-quenching drinks with sugar, but this particular
        salted drink holds up well on its own. A little cumin, some mint, and the optional dash of chili powder makes it
        sound like an odd drink to sip with a meal, but somehow it works as a refreshment. And the amount of salt here
        is miniscule compared to what is in Gatorade.</p>
    <p>So when the weather finally calmed down last weekend and the thermometer almost reached 70 degrees, I made this,
        sat on the concrete stoop, and basked in the sun. At least until the afternoon winds picked up again. My
        environment wasn't quite India, but after months of chilly weather, it was close enough.</p>
