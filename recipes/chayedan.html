    <h1>茶叶蛋 Chinese Tea Eggs</h1>

    <p>Chinese marbled tea eggs, stewed in a black tea/soy sauce/spice blend, are a ubiquitous and cheap snack sold
        allaround China in snack stands and convenience stores. The aromas of tea, cinnamon, star anise, and soy sauce
        are intoxicating, just perfect for fall. The eggs are also easy to make at home. Getting the marbling effect is
        as
        simple as cracking the eggs once they're cooked. You can use any black tea; just avoid green tea since it's too
        astringent to use for simmering.) The eggs can be simmered for 1 to 2 hours; longer simmering means a more
        intense flavor and color.</p>
    <p>Once the eggs are cooked, you can eat them hot or cold as a snack. I've made lazy meals out of just 2 eggs over
        ramen noodles, or chopped up eggs over fried rice. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 eggs, any size</li>
        <li>2 tea bags of black tea </li>
        <li>1/2 cup soy sauce or tamari</li>
        <li>2 pieces star anise</li>
        <li> 1 cinnamon stick</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon cracked black peppercorn (optional)</li>
        <li> 2 to 3 strips dried mandarin peel (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add enough water to a medium pot to cover the eggs. Bring the water to a boil, then lower the heat to simmer
            for 10 minutes, until the eggs are hard-boiled.</li>
        <li>Remove the eggs with a strainer and run under cold water until they are cool enough to handle. Tap the eggs
            with the back of a butter knife to crack them evenly all around, being careful not to peel off the shells.
            Return the eggs to the pot.</li>
        <l1> In the same pot, add the tea bags, soy sauce, star anise, cinnamon, black peppercorns, and orange peel (if
            using). Add enough water to cover the eggs by an inch. Bring the liquid to a boil, then lower the heat to a
            bare simmer. Allow the eggs to simmer for 1 to 2 hours, longer for a more intense flavor and color. (You can
            also turn off the heat and allow them to steep in the hot liquid for 1 to 2 hours, although the color may
            not get as intense.)
            <li>Remove from the heat and drain the eggs, saving a little of the liquid to serve with the eggs if you
                choose. You can either peel and serve the eggs immediately or store them in the fridge for up to 4 days
                in a tightly covered container. Serve as a snack as-is or as an addition to rice or noodles.</li>
