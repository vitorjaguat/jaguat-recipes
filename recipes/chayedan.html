    <p>Chinese marbled tea eggs, stewed in a black tea/soy sauce/spice blend, are a ubiquitous and cheap snack sold
        allaround China in snack stands and convenience stores. The aromas of tea, cinnamon, star anise, and soy sauce
        are intoxicating, just perfect for fall. The eggs are also easy to make at home. Getting the marbling effect is
        as
        simple as cracking the eggs once they're cooked. You can use any black tea; just avoid green tea since it's too
        astringent to use for simmering.) The eggs can be simmered for 1 to 2 hours; longer simmering means a more
        intense flavor and color.</p>
    <p>Once the eggs are cooked, you can eat them hot or cold as a snack. I've made lazy meals out of just 2 eggs over
        ramen noodles, or chopped up eggs over fried rice. </p>
